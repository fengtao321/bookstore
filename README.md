# bookstore
an online book store website prototype
This a a project for SEG 3125 (Analysis and Design of User Interfaces). I connected the home page with mySQL database,
so the user can Add books to a shopping cart and check out by providing payment. It also includes some other functions,
which allows the user to browse through books by category, search for a particular book, add books to a shopping cart
and check out by providing payment and shipping information. 

I drew the background pictures with many cartoon elements, for personal preference. Some persons feel it is a little too naive~^_^
